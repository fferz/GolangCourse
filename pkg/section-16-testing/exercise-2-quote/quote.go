const SerenaWilliams = `If Serena Williams had retired in 2005, she’d have been a surefire Hall of Famer, 
with seven Grand Slam singles titles and six more, with her sister, Venus, in doubles. The duo had also elevated 
women’s tennis from second tier to a league of its own, drawing new viewers and inspiring a generation of female athletes.
Had Williams quit in 2012 after an extended subpar stretch, she’d have been a legend, with 13 singles Slams — the fourth 
most in tennis’ Open era, which began in 1968 — and 12 doubles titles that tied her for third, with Venus.
If Williams had stayed home after having a baby in 2017, she’d have filled the history books with her 23 single Slams, 
the most in the Open era, earning recognition as the greatest women’s tennis player but also among the best of either 
gender. By then, she was one of the most dominant athletes ever, earning comparisons not just to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, 
but to Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan and Tom Brady.`
